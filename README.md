## 🧑‍💻 Project Workflow

1. **User asks a question or uploads a file.**
2. **Backend assembles prompts** (system, user, memory).
3. **LLM identifies intent:**
    - If information retrieval is needed → uses RAG to fetch supporting context.
    - If an action is needed → generates a function call to trigger (ex: calendar API).
    - If structured output is needed → returns result in the requested format.
4. **User receives answer**—with citations, actions completed, or data structured for easy re-use.
5. **Conversation history is updated** for personalized, smarter future exchanges.
