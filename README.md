🧑💻 Project Workflow
User asks a question or uploads a file.

Backend assembles prompts (system, user, memory).

Intent Detection:

Info retrieval → RAG fetches context.

Action → Function call (e.g., calendar API).

Structured output → Requested format (JSON, Markdown, table).

User receives answer—with citations, completed actions, or structured data.

Conversation history is updated for smarter, personalized exchanges.

🏆 Evaluation Criteria
Correctness
Answers and actions are accurate, relevant, and always grounded in provided data and documents.

Structured outputs are validated for format and integrity before delivery.

Efficiency
Fast response times via optimized retrieval and lightweight orchestration.

Backend routes requests to the right submodule (RAG, Function Calling, Output Formatter) instantly.

Scalability
Supports high user volume and large documents through modular, stateless API design.

Utilizes cloud-native storage and batching; horizontal scaling lets the platform handle spikes without performance loss.
